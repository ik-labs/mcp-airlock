# Security Documentation

This section contains security architecture documentation, threat models, and security procedures for MCP Airlock.

## Available Documentation

- [Security Architecture](architecture.md) - Overall security design and principles
- [Threat Model](threat-model.md) - Identified threats and mitigations
- [Security Controls](controls.md) - Detailed security control implementations
- [Compliance](compliance.md) - Regulatory compliance information
- [Security Procedures](procedures.md) - Security operational procedures

## Security Overview

MCP Airlock implements a zero-trust security model with multiple layers of protection:

1. **Authentication**: OIDC/JWT validation with JWKS caching
2. **Authorization**: OPA/Rego policy engine with fine-grained controls
3. **Data Protection**: DLP redaction and encryption at rest/transit
4. **Audit**: Comprehensive logging with hash chaining for tamper detection
5. **Network Security**: TLS termination and network policies
6. **Container Security**: Non-root execution and read-only filesystems

## Security Principles

- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Fail Closed**: Security failures result in request denial
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Secure by Default**: Secure configuration out of the box
